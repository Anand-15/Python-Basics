    "    1.Numeric: In Python, numeric data type represent the data which has numeric value. Numeric value can be integer, floating                number or even complex numbers. These values are defined as int, float and complex class in Python.\n",
    "    2.Sequence type: In Python, sequence is the ordered collection of similar or different data types. Sequences allows to                          store multiple values in an organized and efficient fashion. There are several sequence types in Python \n",
    "                          a)String\n",
    "                          b)List\n",
    "                          c)Tuple\n",
    "    3.Boolean : Data type with one of the two built-in values, True or False. Boolean objects that are equal to True are truthy                 (true), and those equal to False are falsy (false). But non-Boolean objects can be evaluated in Boolean context                 as well and determined to be true or false. It is denoted by the class bool."
